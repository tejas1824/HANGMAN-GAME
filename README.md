# Hangman Game

## Introduction
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. With each incorrect guess, a part of a gallows and a victim is drawn. The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or when the full diagram is drawn.
